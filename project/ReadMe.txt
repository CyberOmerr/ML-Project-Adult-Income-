# ... etc

üìã Task Details
Task 1: Data Loading and EDA
bash

cd project/practical
python task1.py

    Purpose: Initial data exploration and visualization

    Outputs: Dataset statistics, correlation heatmaps, missing value analysis

    Files Created: Dataset download (adult.data), various plots

Task 2: Preprocessing Pipeline
bash

python task2.py

    Purpose: Data cleaning, encoding, and scaling

    Dependencies: Requires Task 1 to be run first

    Output: Preprocessing pipeline validation

Task 3: Model Training
bash

python task3.py

    Purpose: Train and optimize machine learning models

    Dependencies: Requires Tasks 1-2

    Outputs: Trained models, performance metrics, ROC curve, saved model file (adult_rf_model.joblib)

Task 4: Scratch Implementation
bash

python task4.py

    Purpose: Educational implementation of Logistic Regression

    Note: Optional task, uses synthetic data

Task 5: API Deployment
bash

python task5.py

    Purpose: Create REST API for model predictions

    Dependencies: Requires trained model from Task 3

    API: FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000

Task 6: Explainability and Robustness
bash

python task6.py

    Purpose: Model interpretation and robustness testing

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

    Execution Order: Run tasks 1-3 sequentially for proper data flow

    File Dependencies:

        Task 2 requires data from Task 1

        Task 3 requires preprocessing from Task 2

        Task 5 requires the saved model from Task 3

        Task 6 requires model and test data from previous tasks

    Internet Connection: Required for Task 1 to download dataset

    File Paths: All tasks assume execution from the practical/ directory

üîß Troubleshooting

Common Issues:

    ModuleNotFoundError: Ensure you're in the practical/ directory and dependencies are installed

    FileNotFoundError: Run tasks in correct order (1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 6)

    API not starting: Check if port 8000 is available

Solutions:
bash

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check current directory
pwd  # Should be project/practical/

# Force re-download dataset
rm adult.data  # Then re-run task1.py
